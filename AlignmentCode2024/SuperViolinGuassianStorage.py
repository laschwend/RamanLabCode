Purpose: generate excel data to use with Superviolin plot, makes 1 big spreadsheet with all the bins and direction values 
repeated according to their weights in the histogram (this probably breaks statistics from superviolin as a warning, edit the code later)
The relative shapes and means in the violin plot are correct, need to scale the Stddev appropriately
